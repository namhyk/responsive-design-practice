          my profile.

        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend 
          Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to 
          the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo 
          Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

        How I stay committed to learning
      </p><br>
      <p>
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to 
        create simple projects using what I learned or work new 
        techniques into existing projects.
      </p><br>
      <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
        share what I was learning and most things about my journey 
        with the world.
      </p><br>
      <p class="bold">
        How I got started
      </p><br>
      <p>
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
        I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning 
        session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but 
        also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized 
        that posting my learning summaries was also helping others 
        learn and stay motivated.
