      <p class="blog-title">My new journey as a bootcamp student.</p>
      <p class="blog-overview-text">After several months of learning in the 
        Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp 
        to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded 
        peers.</p>

      <p class="bold">How I stay committed to learning</p><br>
      <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to 
        create simple projects using what I learned or work new 
        techniques into existing projects.
      </p><br>
      <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
        share what I was learning and most things about my journey with 
        the world.
      </p><br>
      <p class="bold">How I got started
      </p><br>
      <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
        I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning 
        session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned 
        but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
      </p><br>
      <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that 
        posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and 
        stay motivated.</p><br>
